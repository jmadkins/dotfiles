# My Dotfiles

Files that are used to setup my development environment. A lot of what is here was taken from what [some](https://github.com/J3RN/dotfiles) [of](https://github.com/bseb/dotfiles) my coworkers had already established for themselves.

## Vim Configuration

Vim config that I borrowed from a [coworker.](https://github.com/J3RN/vim-config) and have slightly altered.

### Requirements

A [powerline font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts). I use Hack.

### Plugins
