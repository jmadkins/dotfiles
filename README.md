# Justin Adkins Dot Files

These are config files to setup a system the way I like it. If you like something, feel free to use it!

I am running macOS, but it will likely work on Linux as well. A [powerline font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) is required, I recommend Hack.

## Installation

Running the following command after cloning the repo

```shell
./install.sh
```

## Shell

For my shell I use [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh/) [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) manages plugins which are stored in `.zshrc`.

## Vim

Plugins are managed with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and stored in `.vim/vundle.vim`.

## Credit

A large portion of the code here was borrowed from [some](https://github.com/J3RN/dotfiles) [of](https://github.com/bseb/dotfiles) my coworkers. Their setups inspired me to make the jump to vim so it was only fitting.
