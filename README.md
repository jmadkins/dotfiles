# My Dotfiles

Various configuration files used to setup my development environment. If you like something, feel free to use it!

A [powerline font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) is required, I recommend Hack.

Currently, I'm configuring the following items with my dotfiles

* Git
* Shell
* Vim
* Homebrew

## Getting Started

```shell
./install.sh
```

## Shell

For my shell I use [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh/) [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) manages plugins which are stored in `.zshrc`.

## Vim

Plugins are managed with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and stored in `.vim/vundle.vim`.

## Credit

A large portion of the code here was borrowed from [some](https://github.com/J3RN/dotfiles) [of](https://github.com/bseb/dotfiles) my coworkers. Their setups inspired me to make the jump to vim so it was only fitting.
