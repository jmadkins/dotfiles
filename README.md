# My Dotfiles

Files that are used to setup my development environment. A [powerline font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) is required, I recommend Hack.

## Zsh configuration

[Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) is used to manage plugins and they're stored in `.zshrc`.

## Vim Configuration

Plugins are managed with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and stored in `.vim/vundle.vim`.

## Credit

A lot of what is here was taken from what [some](https://github.com/J3RN/dotfiles) [of](https://github.com/bseb/dotfiles) my coworkers had already established for themselves.
